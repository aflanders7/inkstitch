Ink/Stitch: digitize machine embroidery designs using Inkscape (SVG)

## Accessability

* Cross Platform (Linux, Windows, macOS)
* User interface translated to several languages ([translation help appreciated](https://translate.inkstitch.org))

## Stitch Types

* Various [stitch types](/docs/stitch-library/): Fill stitch, satin stitch, stroke type stitches
* Custom [Patterns](/docs/stitches/patterns/) can be applied to all available stitch types.

### Fill Stitch

* Adjust stitch length, row spacing and row angle
* Underlay
* [Contour fill](/docs/stitches/contour-fill/)
* [Guided fill](/docs/stitches/guided-fill/)

### Satin Stitch
* Design your [satin column](/docs/stitches/satin-column/) with varying width
* Mix and match 3 kinds of underlay (center-walk underlay, contour underlay, zig-zag underlay)
* [E-stitch](/docs/stitches/e-stitch/)
* Split stitch (through maximum stitch length)
* [Automatic routing](/docs/satin-tools/) (with underpathing running stitch if needed)

### Stroke Type Stitches

* [Running stitch](/docs/stitches/running-stitch/)
* [Bean stitch](/docs/stitches/bean-stitch/)

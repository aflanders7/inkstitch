The params dialog is one of the main features of Ink/Stitch. With this dialog you control how your elements will be stitched out. Along with many other details you can define for example stitch length and distances. It is also possible to save your own preferences and load them whenever you want.

`Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params` opens the params dialog.

It is dependend on the element type which param tabs are available. More details about available params can be found in the stitch library section of this website. For orientation you will find a rough stitch type overview on this page.

## Params Simulator Preview

The params simulator helps you to get a visual impression of the stitch settings for the selected elements.

Please note, that this will not always show exactly what you will get in the end.
{: .notice--warning }

There are a few things to should keep in mind:

1. **Please, do not select satin and stroke stitch types at the same time**. The simulator and the params settings can only handle them separately.
2. The simulator **ignores settings for the minimum stitch length and the minimum jump stitch length**. This means, you may see extra stitches which will be deleted by the minimum stitch length setting - and you may see lock stitches which may be removed by the minimum jump stitch setting.

Use `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Visualize and Export > Simulator / Realistic Preview` for a more complete preview.

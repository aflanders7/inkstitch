The params dialog is one of the main features of Ink/Stitch. With this dialog you control how your elements will be stitched out. Along with many other details you can define for example stitch length and distances. It is also possible to save your own preferences and load them whenever you want.

`Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params` opens the params dialog.

It is dependend on the element type which param tabs are available. More details about available params can be found in the stitch library section of this website. For orientation you will find a rough stitch type overview on this page.

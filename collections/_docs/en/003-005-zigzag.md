## What it is

Zig-Zag stitches are a very basic option to create a simple zig-zag line.

## How to Create

Zig-Zag stitches can be created by using a **continuous line** (without dashes).

Ink/Stitch will create stitches along the path using the **stroke width** you specified.

Go to `Object > Fill and Stroke...` and set the desired stroke width in the `Stroke style` tab.

## Params

Open `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params` to change parameters to your needs.

Settings|Description
---|---
Running stitch along paths    |Must be enabled for these settings to take effect.
Method                        |Choose `ZigZag Stitch`
Repeats                       |◦ Defines how many times to run down and back along the path<br />◦ Default: 1 (traveling once from the start to the end of the path)<br />◦ Odd number: stitches will end at the end of the path<br />◦ Even number: stitching will return to the start of the path
Zig-Zag spacing (peak-to-peak)|Distance between zigzag stitches. The height is defined by the stroke width.
Pull compensation             |Zigzag stitches pull the fabric together, resulting in a column narrower than you draw in Inkscape. This widens the zigzag line.
Allow lock stitches           |Enables lock stitches in only desired positions
Force lock stitches           |Sew lock stitches after sewing this element, even if the distance to the next object is smaller than defined in the collapse length value value in the Ink/Stitch prefreneces.
Tack stitch                   |Select [tack stitch](/docs/stitches/lock-stitches) type (start).
Lock stitch                   |Select [lock stitch](/docs/stitches/lock-stitches) type (end).
Trim After                    |Trim the thread after sewing this object.
Stop After                    |Stop the machine after sewing this object. Before stopping it will jump to the stop position (frame out) if defined.

## Tips:

### Satin Column: A Better Option

It is not recommended to use the Zig-Zag Stitch Mode to create a satin border, use [Satin Column](/docs/stitches/satin-column/) instead.

Ink/Stitch will plot zig-zags to the left and right of the line from start to end, but it won’t do anything special around curves and corners. Sharper curves and corners will result in sparse stitching around the outside of the curve and dense stitching around the inside. This won’t look good and may even poke holes in the insides of corners.

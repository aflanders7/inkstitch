## What it is

Zig-Zag stitches are a very basic option to create a simple zig-zag line.

## How to Create

Zigzag stitch is created by a path with a stroke color.

Ink/Stitch will create stitches along the path using the **stroke width** you specified as the zigzag width.

The stitch direction can be influenced by the path direction. If you want to swap the starting and ending point of your zigzag run Path > Reverse.

If an object consists of multiple paths, they will be stitched in order with a jump between each.



In former versions of Ink/Stitch  Zig-Zag stitches were  created by using a **continuous line** (without dashes).

Go to `Object > Fill and Stroke...` and set the desired stroke width in the `Stroke style` tab.

## Params

Open `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params` to change parameters to your needs.

Settings|Description
---|---
Running stitch along paths    |Must be enabled for these settings to take effect.
Method                        |Choose `ZigZag Stitch`
Repeats                       |◦ Defines how many times to run down and back along the path<br />◦ Default: 1 (traveling once from the start to the end of the path)<br />◦ Odd number: stitches will end at the end of the path<br />◦ Even number: stitching will return to the start of the path
Pull compensation             |Zigzag stitches pull the fabric together, resulting in a column narrower than you draw in Inkscape. This widens the zigzag line. You can use it to change the width of your zigzag. Negative values are allowed.
Zig-Zag spacing (peak-to-peak)|Distance between zigzag stitches. The height is defined by the stroke width.
Minimum stitch length         ||Overwrite global minimum stitch length setting. Shorter stitches than that will be removed.
Minimum  jump stitch  length             ||Overwrite global minimum jump stitch length setting. Shorter distances to the next object will have no lock stitches.
Allow lock stitches           |Enables lock stitches in only desired positions
Force lock stitches           |Sew lock stitches after sewing this element, even if the distance to the next object is smaller than defined in the collapse length value value in the Ink/Stitch prefreneces.
Tack stitch                   |Select [tack stitch](/docs/stitches/lock-stitches) type (start).
Lock stitch                   |Select [lock stitch](/docs/stitches/lock-stitches) type (end).
Trim After                    |Trim the thread after sewing this object.
Stop After                    |Stop the machine after sewing this object. Before stopping it will jump to the stop position (frame out) if defined.

## Tips:

### Satin Column: A Better Option

It is not recommended to use the Zig-Zag Stitch Mode to create a satin border, use [Satin Column](/docs/stitches/satin-column/) instead.

Ink/Stitch will plot zig-zags to the left and right of the line from start to end, but it won’t do anything special around curves and corners. Sharper curves and corners will result in sparse stitching around the outside of the curve and dense stitching around the inside. This won’t look good and may even poke holes in the insides of corners.

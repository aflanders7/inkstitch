A version for **NixOS** is externally maintained and available at [https://codeberg.org/tropf/nix-inkstitch](https://codeberg.org/tropf/nix-inkstitch)

## Manual Setup

It is possible to install Ink/Stitch manually. It is not recommended though - unless you want to help developing the extension.
In this case, please have a look at the [developer documentation](/developers/inkstitch/manual-setup/) section.

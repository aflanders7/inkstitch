## What it is

[![E-Stitch Dolphin](/assets/images/docs/e-stitch-example.jpg){: width="200x"}](/assets/images/docs/e-stitch.svg){: title="Download SVG File" .align-left download="e-stitch.svg" }
It's biggest purpose is for a simple (and yet deceivingly strong) cover stitch for applique items. Mainly for baby cloths as their skin tends to be more sensitive.

## How to Create

Prepare your path exactly as you would with a [Satin Column](/docs/stitches/satin-column). But in Params enable `"E" stitch`. Don't forget to enlarge the zig-zag spacing for this stitch type.

**Tip:** If the points are facing into the wrong direction, just use the ["flip satin column rails"](/docs/satin-tools/#flip-satin-column-rails) extension. Or enable the `Swap rails` option in te params dialog.

## Params

Have a look at the [satin stitch params](/docs/stitches/satin-column/#params).

Try the following steps in order to test the extension and to learn the basic functionality.

**Tip:** If you are new to Inkscape, have a look at their [Basic Tutorial](https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/basic/tutorial-basic.html) first.

## Step 1 - Tegn et objekt

Opret et objekt, f.eks. en cirkel og sÃ¸rg for, at det har fyld.

## Step 2 - Konverter til sti (optimalt)

Ink/Stitch works best with path objects. We recommend to transform objects you want to stitch to paths:

* Select all objects (`Ctrl+A`)
* `Path > Object to Path` or `Ctrl+Alt+C`.

## Step 3 - Parametrize SVG Path for Embroidery

* Select at least one object.
* Open `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params`.
* Play with the values. The simulator will update whenever you change the settings.
* For now, close without saving.

## Step 4 - Lav en broderi-fil

* Run `File > Save as...`
* Navigate to the folder where you would like to save the file
* Choose the correct file format for your machine
* Click `Save`
* Copy the file to your machine

**Tipp:** Make sure to save the file as an SVG file as well. Then you will always be able to modify it easily.

## Workflow

If this worked well, we recommend to also read through the next page (workflow). Where you can get a deeper insight into Ink/Stitch and you can learn how to perform essential functions for embroidery files, like e.g. ordering objects, etc.

If you run into trouble, contact us through [GitHub](https://github.com/inkstitch/inkstitch/issues/). We really like to hear about your problem, this way we can either improve the documentation or the program itself.

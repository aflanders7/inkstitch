Patterns are created by special stitch positioning.

## Generate Patterns

In Ink/Stitch you can generate patterns by either adding stitches or removing stitches from any existing embroidery element.

1. **Create embroidery element(s).** This can be either a satin column or fill area. Patterns will also work on strokes, but they may not be the best target for patterns.

2. **Create pattern path(s).** A pattern consists of strokes or fill areas (or both at the same time). Strokes will be used to add stitches, while patterns with a fill will remove stitches from the embroidery element.

3. Select both, the embroidery element and the pattern and hit `Ctrl+G` to **group them together**.

4. **Convert to pattern.** Select only the pattern and run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Edit > Selection to pattern`. This will add a start marker to the pattern element to indicate, that it will not be embroidered but will be used as a pattern for all elements in the same group. Elements in subgroups of the very same group will not be affected.

## Remove Pattern Marker

The pattern marker can be removed in the fill and stroke panel (`Ctrl+Shift+F`). Open the Stroke style tab and set the first dropdown list in "Markers" to  the very first (empty) option.

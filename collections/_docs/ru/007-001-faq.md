## Using Ink/Stitch

### Guideline Origin isn't working!

The guideline method for setting the origin (0,0) is **deprecated**.

Use [**visual commands**](/docs/commands) instead:
* Go to `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Commands > Add Commands â€¦` and choose `Origin`
* Place the symbol ![origin](/assets/images/docs/visual-commands-origin.jpg) where you like the origin to be.

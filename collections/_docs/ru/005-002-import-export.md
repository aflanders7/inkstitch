## Export Embroidery Files

Export files directly through Inkscapes `File > Save a copy ...` (`Ctrl + Shift + Alt + S`) dialog.

Select a file format that your embroidery machine can read and `Save` the file in your desired output directory.

For later changes make sure that you keep an SVG version of your design as well.

## Batch Export

**Info:** Since Ink/Stitch version 1.10.0 it is possible to export to multiple file formats at once.

Go to `File > Save a copy...` and click on the little arrow on the file format selection field to open a list of available file formats.

Navigate to your desired output folder and choose the Ink/Stitch ZIP file format. Click `Save`. You then will be asked which file formats you wish to be included.

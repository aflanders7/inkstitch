[Pyembroidery](https://github.com/inkstitch/pyembroidery) is a python library for the reading and writing of embroidery files.

Follow the link above. The README file has a lot of information how it can be used and how it is working.

## Background

Ink/Stitch started out using [libembroidery](https://github.com/Embroidermodder/Embroidermodder/tree/master/libembroidery), developed by the Embroidermodder team.

@tartarize then provided a conversion to python (pyembroidery) to make it even more useful for Ink/Stitch (or any other python based embroidery project).

The pyembroidery version used by the Ink/Stitch organization is a fork of [his work](https://github.com/EmbroidePy/pyembroidery).

## Embroidery File Formats

The [EduTech wiki](http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Machine_embroidery) is a good resource for embroidery concepts.

You can also find very detailed information about [embroidery file formats](http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Embroidery_format).

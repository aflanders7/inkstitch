## Debugging

When an empty file named `DEBUG` exists, Ink/Stitch will try to connect to `PyDev` (if it can't, it will continue on without debugging). Also it will generate SVG files for debugging.

## Profiling

Create an empty file named `PROFILE` in your inkstitch directory. Ink/Stitch will then run under a profiler and dump the result to profile_stats.  It will tell you what functions take how long to run.

Install snakeviz with `pip install snakeviz`.

Open the statistics with `snakeviz profile_stats.prof`. This will display a really useful interactive graph in your browser.

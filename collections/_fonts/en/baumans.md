## Dimensions

At 100%, this font is roughly 32 mm high (1.25 in).

Baumans FI Small is a variation of this font with different embroidery settings. Pull compensation, density and underlays are different to allow to scale down between 30% (10 mm, 0.4 inch) and 15% (5mm ,1/5 inch). 
That's why in the lettering dialog window, if using Baumans FI Small, you will have to pick up a scale between 15 and 30%. 

Contrarly to Baumans FI, Baumans FI Small  **MUST** be embroidered with thread and needle smaller than usual.
A USA 8 (EUR 60) size needle, and 60WT thread **MUST** be used.
